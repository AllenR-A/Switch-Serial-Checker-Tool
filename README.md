# Switch-Serial-Checker-Tool
A CMSC 22 Java Project in UP Visays [Mr. Pabroquez]

## What is it?
It's basically the same as [these](https://ismyswitchpatched.com/) [sites](https://damota.me/ssnc/checker) but can be run offline. <br />
Since some prolly just want to know but might not have internet for some reason.<br />
Though unfortunately, some internet access might be needed as a **very useful** guide when modifying the Switch.
